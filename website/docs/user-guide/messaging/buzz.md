# Buzz

The Buzz adapter connects Hermes to a [Buzz](https://github.com/block/buzz) community — Block's open-source human+agent collaboration platform built on the Nostr protocol — and relays messages between Buzz channels (or DMs) and the agent. Outbound traffic shells out to the `buzz` CLI binary ("JSON in, JSON out"); inbound uses a native Nostr WebSocket subscription (via the already-bundled `websockets` package) with CLI polling as fallback. **No extra Python packages are required** — just the `buzz` binary.

Buzz renders markdown, so agent replies keep their formatting. Outbound images are delivered as uploads (local files) or links (URLs). For inbound messages from authorized senders, same-relay Markdown images under Buzz's content-addressed `/media/` path are downloaded with the agent identity's existing Buzz authentication, integrity-checked against the URL hash, cached locally with owner-only permissions, and passed through Hermes' normal image pipeline. External image URLs remain links. Replies can thread onto an existing message via its event id. When progress or status messages are enabled, they inherit the triggering Buzz event as their reply anchor instead of appearing as unrelated top-level channel posts.

Inbound messages arrive over a persistent NIP-42-authenticated Nostr WebSocket subscription by default (near-instant delivery), with automatic fallback to CLI polling when the WebSocket can't be established. Outbound messages always go through the `buzz` CLI. Control it with `transport` / `BUZZ_TRANSPORT`: `auto` (default), `websocket` (require WS, fail otherwise), or `poll`. If your relay membership uses NIP-OA owner attestation, set `BUZZ_AUTH_TAG` to the four-string auth tag JSON.

## Prerequisites

- The `buzz` CLI binary on your `PATH` (or point `BUZZ_CLI_PATH` at it) — build it from the [Buzz repo](https://github.com/block/buzz) with `cargo build --release -p buzz-cli`
- A Buzz community relay URL (e.g. `https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz`)
- A Nostr private key (nsec or hex) whose identity is already a **member** of that community

## Configure Hermes

You can configure Buzz two ways — the `gateway` block in `config.yaml` (canonical) or environment variables (which override it). The private key is a **secret** and always belongs in `~/.hermes/.env`.

### Option A — config.yaml

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      enabled: true
      extra:
        relay_url: https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz
        channels:                  # channel UUIDs to watch (empty = all joined)
          - ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        home_channel: ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        poll_interval: 4           # seconds between inbound poll sweeps
        cli_path: ""               # buzz binary (default: PATH, then ~/bin/buzz)
        credentials_file: ""       # JSON file with the nsec (BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY fallback)
        allowed_users: []          # public hex pubkeys or npubs
        allow_all_users: false     # secure default: deny unlisted senders
        require_mention: true      # require a mention in shared channels (default: true)
        thread_require_mention: true  # require a fresh mention in thread replies (default: true)
```

Plus, in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```
BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY=nsec1...
```

### Option B — environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` | ✅ | Base URL of the community relay |
| `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | Nostr private key (nsec or hex) — the only secret |
| `BUZZ_CHANNELS` | — | Comma-separated channel UUIDs to watch (default: all joined channels) |
| `BUZZ_HOME_CHANNEL` | — | Channel UUID for cron / notification delivery (defaults to the first watched channel) |
| `BUZZ_ALLOWED_USERS` | — | Comma-separated npubs or hex pubkeys allowed to talk to the agent |
| `BUZZ_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | — | Allow any community member to talk to the agent |
| `BUZZ_REQUIRE_MENTION` | — | Require a mention in shared channels (`true`/`false`, default: `true`) |
| `BUZZ_THREAD_REQUIRE_MENTION` | — | Require a fresh mention in thread replies (`true`/`false`, default: `true`) |
| `BUZZ_POLL_INTERVAL` | — | Seconds between inbound poll sweeps (default: 4) |
| `BUZZ_CLI_PATH` | — | Path to the `buzz` binary (default: `buzz` on PATH, then `~/bin/buzz`) |
| `BUZZ_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | — | JSON credentials file holding the nsec, used when `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` is unset |

## Recommended default settings

When wiring up Buzz, set these defaults in `config.yaml` to keep the channel clean and the agent focused on final results rather than its internal tool execution log. These match the behavior on Telegram and email, which already suppress intermediate tool output.

```yaml
display:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      interim_assistant_messages: false   # suppress intermediate tool results, reasoning comments, and progress updates — only the final response reaches the channel
      tool_progress: off                  # suppress tool progress bubbles (e.g., "Running terminal command...", "Reading file...")
gateway:
  platforms:
    buzz:
      enabled: true
      extra:
        relay_url: https://mycommunity.communities.buzz.xyz
        channels:                         # channel UUIDs to watch (empty = all joined)
          - ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        home_channel: ccc2bc1a-7a82-5a8f-8c4e-57a070cbe7cd
        poll_interval: 4                  # seconds between inbound poll sweeps (default 4 — balances latency vs. relay load)
        cli_path: ""                      # buzz binary (default: PATH, then ~/bin/buzz)
        credentials_file: ""              # JSON file with the nsec (BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY fallback)
        allowed_users: []                 # empty = allow all if allow_all_users is true; otherwise restrict to listed npubs/hex pubkeys
        require_mention: true             # in channels: only respond when addressed (@name, npub, or hex pubkey); DMs always dispatch regardless
        thread_require_mention: true      # in threads: require a fresh mention (set false to allow active-thread follow-ups)
        allow_all_users: false            # set true for community mode (everyone can chat, only owner is admin); false for private mode (only allowed_users)
```

**Why these defaults:**

- `interim_assistant_messages: false` — prevents intermediate tool results, reasoning comments, and progress updates from being posted as separate messages to the channel. Only the final response goes to the channel.
- `tool_progress: off` — suppresses tool progress bubbles (e.g., "Running terminal command...", "Reading file..."). Keeps the channel focused on actual results, not process.
- `poll_interval: 4` — balances inbound latency (up to 4s delay) against relay load. Lower values increase polling frequency; higher values reduce it.
- `allowed_users: []` + `allow_all_users: false` — private mode by default. Only listed users can interact. Set `allow_all_users: true` for community mode where everyone can chat (admin tier still restricted to the owner).
- `require_mention: true` — in channels, the agent only responds when addressed. DMs always dispatch regardless of this setting.
- `thread_require_mention: true` — preserves strict thread behavior: every reply needs a fresh mention. Set it to `false` to allow unmentioned follow-ups only after Hermes has successfully replied in that thread.

**Rationale:** Channels are for final results and conversation, not for the agent's internal tool execution log. Users see the final answer, not the steps taken to get there. This matches the behavior on Telegram and email, which already have these defaults.

**Exception:** If you want users to see tool progress (e.g., for long-running operations), set `tool_progress: all` — but `interim_assistant_messages` should still be `false` to avoid spamming with every tool result.

## Mentions, channels, and DMs

- `require_mention` controls top-level shared-channel messages; `thread_require_mention` independently controls thread replies. Both default to `true`.
- With `require_mention: true` and `thread_require_mention: false`, a mention is required to start a conversation, then unmentioned follow-ups are accepted only in a thread where Hermes has successfully sent a reply. Unrelated threads remain gated.
- Explicit `BUZZ_REQUIRE_MENTION` and `BUZZ_THREAD_REQUIRE_MENTION` environment values override YAML. Dashboard-saved YAML values take effect on the next inbound Buzz event; a missing or malformed saved value preserves the last working policy.
- In shared channels the agent only responds when **addressed** — by `@name`, its npub, or its hex pubkey. Everything else is ignored.
- If Buzz rejects an outbound message because an `@name` is unknown or ambiguous, Hermes removes only that offending mention marker and retries. If a retry identifies another invalid name, this repeats up to three fallback attempts in total. If the message exceeds Buzz's mention limit, all mention markers are removed for the retry. Readable text, email addresses, reply threads, attachments, and remaining content are preserved; neutralized names do not notify users.
- Direct messages always reach the agent, no mention needed.
- The agent's own messages are never dispatched back to it (self-echo suppression by pubkey), and every event is de-duplicated by event id against a per-channel high-water mark.

### Threads and interactive prompts

Pending interactive questions are scoped to the Buzz thread where Hermes sent
them. A top-level channel event is treated as its own thread root, so the
initiating command and replies such as `/approve`, `/always`, and `/cancel`
resolve to the same gateway session. An unrelated top-level channel post
cancels the old pending interaction and is queued as its own routed turn
instead of being consumed as the clarification answer. Each Buzz thread keeps
its own conversation history and delivery route.

## Access control

By default, `allowed_users` is empty and `allow_all_users` is false, so no unlisted community member is authorized. Add public npubs or 64-character hex pubkeys to `allowed_users`, or explicitly enable `allow_all_users` for community-wide access. Npubs and uppercase or lowercase hex identities are normalized before comparison. Community membership itself is enforced by the relay — only members can post.

Saved `allowed_users` and `allow_all_users` changes take effect on the next authorization check; the gateway does not need to restart. Removing an entry revokes that sender, and removing `allow_all_users: true`, its containing Buzz section, or the config file revokes community-wide access. If a config edit is malformed, Hermes retains the last valid policy until the file is corrected.

Legacy `BUZZ_ALLOWED_USERS` and `BUZZ_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` environment values override the corresponding `config.yaml` key independently, including explicit empty values. `BUZZ_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` accepts `true`, `1`, or `yes` (case-insensitive) as true; all other values are false. Environment changes still require the gateway process environment to be reloaded. Unauthorized messages are rejected silently without an acknowledgement reaction.

Cron jobs and notifications (`deliver=buzz`) are delivered to the **home channel** — `BUZZ_HOME_CHANNEL` if set, otherwise the first watched channel — and work even when cron runs outside the gateway process.

## Run the gateway

```bash
hermes gateway start
```

Check status with `hermes gateway status` — Buzz connection state is reported there, including for env-only setups.

## Notes and limitations

- **Inbound is polled, not streamed.** The `buzz` CLI is request/response, so the adapter polls `buzz messages get` per watched channel every `poll_interval` seconds (default 4). Expect up to one interval of latency on inbound messages. A future optimization is a websocket transport (the Buzz repo ships `buzz-ws-client` for true streaming).
- On (re)connect the adapter seeds its high-water mark from the newest events, so channel history is never replayed into the agent.
- New DM conversations are discovered automatically (every few poll sweeps).
- Protected inbound Buzz images require a recent `buzz` CLI with `buzz media get` support. If authenticated download or integrity validation fails, Hermes preserves the original Markdown link in the message instead of silently dropping it.
- The private key is passed to the CLI via the subprocess environment — it never appears in argv or logs.
